## The Process

Developing Ragdoll, like any tool, is like zooming in on a fractal pattern.

```
          o----o
     o   /
      \ /
       o     o-----o   o
        \   /       \ /
         \ /         o---o
          o
          |
          |
          o
```

The closer you get, the more nuance you discover. And with nuance comes features and edcases yet to cover.

- Define a zoom-level for what "1.0" means
- Highlight how now zoom level is "complete", there will always be more detail
