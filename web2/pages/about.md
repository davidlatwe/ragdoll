Here's a brief overview of how Ragdoll came to be.

**In 2008** Marcus graduated from Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola and ventured into the world as character animator at Meindbender; to work on [The Duplicators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAhSwlFW5r8) and [The Pirate](https://vimeo.com/22342702) amongst others.

**In 2012** He joined Framestore and familiarised himself with the world of physics simulation, developing the technology behind the [*tethers*](https://youtu.be/FZfOvvGV5Q4?t=64) for Alfonso Cuaron's feature film Gravity, and later completed work on the Cloak of Leviation in Doctor Strange.

**In 2015** He started a company called Abstract Factory developing tools in Python for use in production pipelines, including [Avalon](getavalon.github.io/), [Pyblish](https://pyblish.com/), [Qt.py](https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py), [cmdx](https://github.com/mottosso/cmdx) and [Allzpark](allzpark.com/); later recieving the ["Best Tool" award](https://forums.pyblish.com/t/pyblish-award-2020-the-pipeline-conference/618) for Pyblish at the 2020 DigiPro/The Pipeline Conference.

**In 2017** He started a company called [WeightShift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR3hvaY-0hQ) with co-founders Danny Chapman and Tim Daust. They had just wrapped up the [Endorphin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbDd8PH9jio) and [Euphoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATr38G2hR5Y) projects at Natural Motion.

Like Euphoria, WeightShift developed a physically based animation tool, except this one was tailed to Autodesk Maya and got adopted by major feature film studios including Framestore (Harry Potter, Gravity et. al.) and Weta Digital (Avatar, Lord of the Rings et. al.)

**In 2020** Epic purchases WeightShift

**In 2020** `Ragdoll enters chat`

Ragdoll carries on where WeightShift left off, but turns things on its head. Rather than targeting riggers and technical animators, Ragdoll adopts a "no-rigging required" approach.

**Sometime in 2021** Ragdoll is released.
