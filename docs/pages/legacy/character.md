#### Manual Character

To better understand what Character does, let's walk through a manual character using [Active Chain](/documentation/active_chain).

As you can see, nothing special. What a `Character` does in addition to a normal chain is:

| Feature | Description
|:--------|:--------
| Walk Hierarchy | Save precious seconds selecting objects in the right order
| Auto Limits | *(Coming soon)* Automatically generates suitable hinge and socket joints for e.g. knees and shoulders
| Fits Shapes | *(Coming soon)* Automatically resizes shapes to fit the overall character
