Hey you!

We launched our animation software [Ragdoll Dynamics](https://ragdolldynamics.com) the other day and are on now the lookout for someone to author *learning material* on either a full-time or part-time basis.

It would involve:

1. Learning about Ragdoll Dynamics, enough to be dangerous
1. Writing user documentation, primarily for animators, using primarily [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) (Such as [this very page!]())
1. Recording 5-second gifs demonstrating workflow and new features, such as [these!](https://learn.ragdolldynamics.com/releases/2021.05.10/)
1. Recording 5-minute tutorials on making cool things with physics, such as [this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWro9s4rvRI&list=PLL4XIS5Woc6nVsTdsvs0XLmiKmXVCdwXy&index=1)
1. Recording project-based learning material, breaking down a finished animation like what you see on the front page of our website
1. Starting as soon as you're available
1. Remote only, at least until we get an office at which point remote would remain an option
1. With pay from £40,000-60,000/year

To qualify, you don't need experience with Autodesk Maya although it wouldn't hurt. What you *would* need however is:

1. Examples of prior work; such as a tutorial series on [Gnomon Workshop](https://www.thegnomonworkshop.com/), CMIVFX, Digital Tutors or written documentation any equivalent source we can use to gauge your style.
2. A pleasant voice; we can provide equipment like microphone and recording software.

We could compensate you in various ways.

- Salary, from £40-60,000/year
- Per topic, from £200-400
- Per week, from £300-600
- Pro-bono, get a licence for free

Is this you? Do you know someone?
