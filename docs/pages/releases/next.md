description: Recording Performance
---

Highlight for this release is **Recording Performance**, and is part 3 out of 4 of the new [Markers](/releases/2021.09.27/).

- [**ADDED** Performance](#performance) Faster recording is what we all want
- [**ADDED** Markers & Limits](#limits) On par with the previous constraints, but much easier to work with
- [**ADDED** Markers & Constraints](#constraints) That's right!

### Limits

Markers now support the limits you've grown accustomed to from chains and constraints. They are much easier to work with, now that they are built-in to each marker and have an understanding for what a "parent" is.

You should find a lot less need to use `Edit Pivots` from here on, and in the next release you'll also get some interactive manipulators to avoid the Channel Box even more.

### Constraints

You can now constrain two markers!
