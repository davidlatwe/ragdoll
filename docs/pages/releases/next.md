description: Markers 1.0
---

Highlight for this release is **Performance and Mac**, and is the final part of the new [Markers](/releases/2021.09.27/) which are now able to do everything Rigids could, and more.

!!! into "In with the new, out with the old"
    The next few releases will slowly but surely replace Rigids with Markers. So if there is anything you find yourself unable to do with Markers, let us know and we'll get that in there as soon as possible.
