### Performance

In terms of time spent, Ragdoll has three stages.

| # | Stage | Description
|:--|:------|:----------
| 1 | `Evaluation` | This is your character rig - the transform hierarchy, constraints, any deformers, that kind of thing.
| 2 | `Simulation` | Once evaluated, Ragdoll considers all of this data and applies forces, solves constraints, contacts, that kind of thing.
| 3 | `Rendering` | Finally, we need pixels. In the case of Ragdoll, this means generating and uploading geometry to the GPU; including capsules but also your meshes which are converted into "convex hulls".

In the previous release, we focused entirely on workflow which had an indirect impact on `Evaluation` and `Rendering`. One got faster, but the other got slower.

!!! info "Changes in Part 1/4"
    Let's recap what happens in the previous release.

    We tackled Evaluation which boosted performance by 2-10x by unlocking parallelism. Before, the better your character rig benefited from multithreading the *worse* it would perform with Ragdoll. Ragdoll would force any control you simulated into serial evaluation - to compute one after another - because the solver was fundamentally single-threaded.

    With Markers, Ragdoll separated from the overall rig evaluation, which meant (1) your rig can continue running in parallel and (2) Ragdoll could also run in parallel.

    Consider this example.

    | Rigids | Markers
    |:-------|:----------
    | ![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/135705272-0ea9e006-ed66-4f48-a442-42255844104d.png) | ![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/135705269-363db122-7fe9-485d-b5a7-50af36335258.png)

    This is how Maya scheduled evaluation for this scene with `Rigid` versus `Marker`. To the left, everything runs one after the other. It's terrible. To the right, every box is evaluated in parallel. Which means the more boxes and cores you have, the better utilisation you get.

    The scene itself is very simple, it's this one here.

    <img width=300 src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/135705381-df6b9791-b1b5-4aea-818f-660ff6bafe43.png>

    So evaluation got faster, but rendering got slower. All-in-all we gained about 100% performance.

With this release, we'll tackle that rendering block. Let's have a look at what's changed, in order of most-to-least significance.

| Topic  | Savings | Description
|:--------|:--------|:------------
| Change Monitoring | 5-10x | Ignore anything that hasn't actually changed
| Connection Monitoring | 1-5x | Less dependence on time, more on physical connections being made
| Less Dirty Propagation | 3x | Less of a shotgun blast, more like a sniper
| Less CPU to GPU communication | 2x | More buffers, less uniforms

<br>

#### Change Monitoring

In the last release, Ragdoll would repeat itself on each frame.

1. Release all memory from GPU (slow)
2. Generate meshes, like capsules and convex hulls (fast)
3. Upload meshes to GPU (slow)
4. Render (slow)

With this release, steps 1-3 only happens when things change, and only for things that do change.

<br>

#### Connection Monitoring

<br>

#### CPU to GPU Communication

The previous release, and each one before it, had 1 shader per rigid. In the case of 600 rigid bodies, that meant 600 shaders. 600 shaders means 600 parameter updates of primarily color and 600 unique draw calls.

This release consolidates all shaders into *one*. Colors are uploaded only once alongside their geometry and rendered using custom a GLSL shader.

!!! info "DirectX 11"
    If you can't use OpenGL for whichever reason, there is backwards compatibility built-in.

    ```py
    from ragdoll import options
    options.write("useShaders", False)
    ```

    Or via the Ragdoll Preferences.

    Bearing in mind this will cost you 50% of the rendering performance and won't benefit from future shading related features and improvements. It will remain until it's clear whether and how much it is actually used. (Let us know in the chat!)

<br>

#### Future Work

There is at least 4-16x performance left on the table for specialised cases.

| Work | Savings | Benefit
|:-----|:--------|:----
| Optimised Render Items | 4x | Native Maya still renders 4x faster than us
| Instancing for Rendering | 2-4x | Every render item is currently unique which means neither Maya nor your GPU is able to reuse geometry. Instancing is how games is able to render millions of objects on-screen at 60 fps, and best we can hope for is thousands.
| Instancing for Simulation | 2-4x | Likewise, every physics object is unique and, again, instancing in simulation is how games is able to run destruction and have thousands of objects interact in real-time.

The challenge in both of these is deduplication; of identifying which of the many shapes you use can reuse their geometry.

<br>

#### Limitations

Because monitoring for and responding to changes is a hard problem to solve, odds are some things aren't updating the way you expect. If you encounter any such issues, let us know in [the chat](https://ragdolldynamics.com/chat) or ping me directly at marcus@ragdolldynamics.com.

**Known Issues**

| Limitation | Description
|:-----------|:----------
| Constraint frames and translation | Frames are automatically computed based on the position and pivots of a control. Changing the pivot will update the constraint, but changing the position currently does not do a good job updating the constraint at both ends of the connection. Work around this by editing the position or pivot of any children and undo afterwards, to trigger a refresh. Alternatively re-open the scene to refresh everything.

<br>

### Quality of Life

A few things to make your day that much more bright.

<br>

#### Auto Delete

The `Delete All Physics` menu command does what it says on the tin; it deletes all Ragdoll nodes from your Maya scene. But deleting a node, such as the new `rSolver` left behind anything associated with it, like `rGroup` and any `rMarker` nodes.

This releases addresses this by automatically removing anything that depends on the node you delete. For example..

- Deleting a `rMarker` node also deletes any associated lollipop controls
- Deleting a `rGroup` also deletes the associated `rMarker` nodes
- Deleting the `rSolver` deleles all `rGroup` and `rMarker` nodes

Therefore, deleting a solver is now equivalent to `Delete All Physics`, making it much more intuitive to delete things on a whim.

<br>

#### Reset Button

Minor cosmetic improvement, the `Reset to Default` button now has an icon so you can actually *tell* it's a reset button (and not a bug, as many have pointed out ðŸ˜…).

<br>

#### Z-up

The default plane and solver offset was a off in the previous release, this fixes that. You can also manually re-adjust the plane and remove and orientation from the solver node to fix it locally, the solver itself is A-OK.

#### Auto Time

Start simulating at the Maya start time, wherever it may be.
