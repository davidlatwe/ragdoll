<br>

### Fields

Ragdoll now supports all of Maya's native [fields](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2020/ENU/Maya-SimulationEffects/files/GUID-85AEE528-4477-46DF-8B9E-2E8AEC3C8784-htm.html).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153752085-8e748110-75f4-40c7-b05a-bd15d56963e5.png)

!!! question "What are fields?"
    A field represents a set of forces applied to each Marker. Ranging from `Gravity` to `Turbulence`, each field carries unique properties you can use to emulate some environment or environmental effect, like wind and gravity fields along a curve.

!!! question "What is the difference from regular Maya fields?"
    They are the very same!

    If you're already familiar with them, from e.g. nParticles of nCloth, then you can leverage your experience with Ragdoll, and vice versa if you ever venture into nCloth and friends.

Let's walk through these fields one-by-one!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153713200-63ffe691-9718-4e39-a1c3-17669db5821d.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Turbulence

The perhaps most interesting field. Apply forces in "random" directions, based on the worldspace positions of your Markers.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153750169-07891084-b935-4dd1-b69a-7a2863873c5e.mp4 controls

The way to think of turbulence is as Perlin Noise you may have seen in images such as this.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153750302-465f1747-0527-49e6-b946-dd96156eefad.png)

Where the amount of white determines the amount of force being applied. As a Marker travels across this field, both the magnitude and direction changes in interesting ways.

<br>

#### Drag

Apply an *opposite* force to any motion.

The faster things move, the greater the force.

!!! tip "Pro tip"
    This field is similar to Ragdoll's `Air Density`. Not *technically*, but practically.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153750407-dbc9d7eb-4135-488d-8755-48bc532cf029.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Wind

Apply a uniform force, at a given speed, in a given direction. Like wind, including a kitchen fan with some `Spread`.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153750615-bd2eba9e-7a29-407d-94ad-657ef59d4444.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Gravity

A familiar force, except this one can be also be animated!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153750684-25ee1e0b-2120-423d-8189-9bbfd254600e.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Newton

Force Markers towards or away from a point in space.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153719442-8c1b0d88-b4fa-4310-901e-ea79472c3aaa.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Radial

A more curious field; with a force which *increases* as it gets farther from the source.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153750760-da2803c4-1a57-455d-9908-b7cf3a3394f7.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Uniform

Apply a constant force. That's all.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153750848-f8326f5e-863a-4c2b-a052-a39a603e0d1f.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Vortex

Apply forces in a circular pattern.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153750929-9c1a8e2f-c339-4b51-b451-88fe61550433.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Volume Axis Field

A field for when you don't know what field you want.

A true Swiss Army Knife of fields, can do everything from Vortex, to Newton to Turbulence in one convenient node.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153751617-5b291e01-48e7-4974-bc7c-72cc7f701be6.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Volume Curve

Have some fun with this curve-based field. Perhaps to emulate an underwater current?

In this example, I'm also using a `Drag` field to keep things from flying off into space.

!!! tip "Pro tip"
    The curve is a normal Maya NURBS curve. If you need more points, right click and add points as you normally would.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153767442-45e86095-a0c3-4e08-a766-93249648687a.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Combined Fields

Make two or more fields to combine their effect and create complex forces or series of forces!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153752341-8f4956e9-5366-4901-95f6-c228bad85138.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Centroids

Where within each Marker should a field apply forces?

- [ ] Center of Mass
- [x] Volumetric

At the center, forces will be nice and predictable; except they won't be able to introduce *rotations* to your Marker, which may or may not be what you want. For the most realistic fields, use volumetric centroids.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153761018-6395874a-65f9-4a86-8e60-ec98f1b3186a.png)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153760596-0ae4831a-799b-4fb2-a84c-fac4c3cd3843.mp4 controls

Here's another example using the Turbulence Field.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153760597-53ed266c-d8a9-4cb7-aa55-d30e11fc4080.mp4 controls

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153768590-07e9b49e-59fc-4fbc-bc38-420044f436d7.png)

!!! hint "Which is better?"
    Up to you! There is a *tiny* performance penalty for volumetric origins, as the number of forces increase. But you shouldn't notice much if any impact on performance.

<br>

#### Centroid Seed

For complex meshes, centroids can end up in unwanted locations or gather in an area with dense vertices. That's when you can give the algorithm a little jolt to try and see whether there is a better alternative out there.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153838710-891d6604-003f-4eac-8c95-a690adc4aa8f.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Use Selected as Source

Some forces act according to their position in the world. Attach a field to a Marker to create an interesting relationship between the two.

!!! warning "Non-commercial Ragdoll"
    This feature is limited to 100 frames in non-commercial versions of Ragdoll.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/152635411-0f810a24-6e6e-46dc-9f56-4fcdf5494d45.mp4 controls


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153752546-67d71938-afd6-4187-aebd-89165fc77817.mp4 controls

Distance constrain two markers, and attach a field to the outer-most Marker for a doubly-interesting effect. That also wrecks your brain. üôÉ

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153765980-641d3ce2-6c40-4956-8a2e-d75703e94c52.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Field Scale

If forces start becoming large, you may find yourself in a situation where the visualisation needs to tone down just a bit.

In the solver settings, you will find options to scale those lines (i.e. `Field Scale`), as well as control how many steps into the future (i.e. `Field Iterations`) it should draw for you.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153766135-6804cda2-3b85-4560-bf01-f2480fb0dc49.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Ignore Field

Fine-tune the effect of fields by having one or more Markers *ignore* the effect of fields.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153839253-65fa756c-373f-40e3-9c67-e1a4e52884e1.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Force Modes

Fields can apply to your markers in 2 different ways.

!!! question "Which should I use?"
    The default is `Force`, whereas `Impulse` is what is typically used for collision handling. Experiment, and let us know which you prefer!

| Mode             | Description | Math
|:-----------------|:------------|:----------
| Force            | Traditional force            | `mass * distance / time^2`
| Impulse          | Typically used for contacts  | `mass * distance / time`

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153840245-90a8b6b1-1270-4e4a-9849-d973e837aaed.mp4 controls

<br>

### Compound Shape

Combine multiple meshes for a complex "compound shape".

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153766360-534bc842-ac61-471f-9a46-dd1a93735c11.mp4 controls

Vertices connected by edges are considered an "island", each island is then turned into an independent convex hull. Like this complex endevour.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153712923-6f8ffbd6-595a-4a0d-a103-219647e4c89c.mp4 controls

!!! info "434 islands in 147 ms"
    That's how long it took Ragdoll to generate the simulation volumes for the above meshes.

You can slice an dice any mesh to introduce new islands at will, for complete control.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153712924-39379d67-f5a5-479b-82d6-290aef0db388.mp4 controls

!!! question "Performance?"
    If you're wondering what effect this many meshes has on your simulation, the answer is we haven't noticed any. Go crazy, and if you do, let us know!

<br>

#### Mesh Decomposition

Collision shapes are generated from each individual "island"; that is, groups of vertices that are connected by at least one edge. When you combine two or more meshes together, they will naturally form individal islands.

Sometimes, you'd rather treat the entire mesh as one big shape and for that you can use the `Mesh Decomposition = Mesh Islands`.

!!! note "Shape Vertex Limit"
    Also notice how the vertex limit is applied to *each island*. Meaning that you can achieve much higher resolution for your collision shapes by cutting things up into pieces!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153836772-991495dd-9418-4fb7-8015-f9899cc8443c.mp4 controls

<br>

### Quality of Life

<br>

#### Robust Frame Skips

Anyone playing back their simulation to audio may prefer Ragdoll with a `Frameskip Method = Ignore`. Such that it'll keep simulating, even though the result won't be 100% reproducible.

But! If you did, you may have ran into this.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153719239-fc111906-961c-4851-a67f-dde14c846b76.mp4 controls

Notice how it sometimes fails to keep up with fast time changes? Well, no longer!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153719242-a3c5dfe0-0651-4643-ad09-ed6b6695e5b8.mp4 controls

!!! tip "Caveat"
    Like before however, the simulated result you get when frames are skipped will still differ from the result when frames are not skipped, or when different frames get skipped.

    The final recorded result will not skip any frames, so you should use this while working but ensure there aren't any frames skipped when you tune and tweak the final values.

<br>

#### Manipulator and HUD

The View Cube and other viewport ornaments are automatically and temporarily hidden whenever you use the Manipulator. But sometimes, Ragdoll could get confused and leave you having to manually re-enable the viewport HUD.

This has now been fixed, and Ragdoll will more predictably re-enable any HUD it hides.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153719428-da4a3427-42bf-4afa-b039-4bfd11285253.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Kinematic Stiffness

Markers set to `Kinematic` would also lose their stiffness with their parent.

**Before**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153824447-c1a65168-357a-44df-9159-2d37e567ecf5.mp4

**After**

This has now been fixed.

!!! hint "Pro tip"
    To achieve the effect from the previous version, set `Pose Stiffness` to 0

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153824449-038de100-d332-494d-b8b0-eb76d34c5987.mp4

<br>

#### Untrusted Plugin Location

Users of Maya 2022 would experience this dialog when getting started with Ragdoll.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153831679-c87b78ae-03fc-4ba6-a6d2-b249ad975ca7.png)

This has now been fixed.

<br>

#### Negative Scale Edgecase

A rare case was discovered by @BigRoy whereby negatively scaled controllers would yield an incorrect shape drawing. The simulation was fine, but it wasn't looking quite right in the viewport.

**Before**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/153821617-59c29319-dd88-4447-a657-5809aeb69455.mp4

**After**

This has now been fixed!

<br>

#### Import Additions

These attributes were added to the export and import mechanism.

| Nice Name                 | Long Name
|:--------------------------|:------------
| World Pose Translate X    | `driveAbsoluteLinearX`
| World Pose Translate Y    | `driveAbsoluteLinearY`
| World Pose Translate Z    | `driveAbsoluteLinearZ`
| Pose Twist Amount         | `driveAngularAmountTwist`
| Pose Swing Amount         | `driveAngularAmountSwing`

<br>

#### Capsule Length

All this time, capsules had been scaled in an axis that didn't align with your scale manipulator. :blush:

No longer!
