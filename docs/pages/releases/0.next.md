### Leaving Early Bird

Since 28th July 2021, Ragdoll has been publicly available under "early bird" access. Meaning a reduced price point for those brave enough to venture into new territory and expect a few left turns every now and then as kinks are worked out in the software.

Now the time has come to step into the world as an adult piece of software with the guarantees of any commercially available software and a pricing to reflect that.

This release reflects this change and may be considered Ragdoll 1.0, whereas the price will remain in effect for the next *2 weeks*.

!!! info "Price Change"
    On January 30th, prices will reach their intended full price, leaving Early Bird behind.

<br>

#### Ragdoll Complete

"Ragdoll Complete" is the low-cost flavour of Ragdoll, suitable for freelancers and indie studios. It lacks studio-conveniences such as a Python API, export to JSON and is less performant than "Ragdoll Unlimited", being unable to operate in parallel across multiple cores.

So far, Complete has been identical to Unlimited in every way, until now.

<br>

#### Ragdoll Batch

This is the non-interactive version of Ragdoll, doing everything Complete does except rendering. It is invisible and intended for automation such as render farms and background processes. Here's what an artist would see if they accidentally used such a licence interactively.

### Export & Import

A few months ago, the export and import of physics [was introduced](). Then [Markers happened](), and now it's back!

??? question "Can I export scenes I made with an earlier version?"
    Yes, anything made with Markers can be exported regardless of when it was made.

??? question "What is included in the export?"
    Just about everything.

    - Solvers
    - Groups
    - Markers
    - Constraints
    - Attribute changes
    - Retargeting
    - Replaced meshes
    - Thumbnail of your viewport

??? question "What isn't included in the export?"
    Very little.

    - The mesh itself is *not* stored, the mesh is expected to come from your rig. Including any mesh you replace. This may be added in a future release.
    - The cached simulation, although it will be soon.

??? question "Will I get identical results when simulating an imported scene?"
    Yes, anything else is a bug.

    More precisely, determinism depends on (1) the type and number of items in the solver along with (2) the order in which these are created. Both of these are part of the exported file format and is taken into account during import. Meaning you should get identical results so long as the content is the same.

<br>

### Density

Ragdoll can now automatically compute a suitable mass for each Marker, based on the volume of your shape and a density of your choosing.

| Density    | Value
|:-----------|:------------
| `Off`        | Do not compute, use the `Mass` attribute
| `Cotton`     | Very sparse, 0.05 grams per cubic centimeter
| `Wood`       | Sparse, 0.2 grams per cubic centimeter
| `Flesh`      | Default, 1.0g/cm3
| `Uranium`    | Dense, 19.0g/cm3
| `Black Hole` | Very, very dense

In a word, big objects become heavy, small objects become light.

Choose between various densities either at creation-time or afterwards via the new `Density` attribute.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146948273-726f27dc-eecb-45d4-8a5a-567d05447afe.mp4 controls

The computed mass updates interactively as you change the size and type of your shape, including convex hulls!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146948277-f5511ded-8dc4-4136-9b40-e788c20c686a.mp4 controls

Mass is computed based on the *volume* of your shape, along with a density of your choosing.

<br>

#### Max Mass Ratio

With `Auto Mass`, there's a chance Markers get Ragdoll into a situation it does not like; namely that the difference between masses are too great.

??? info "Give me the technical details"
    As you wish. :)

    Ragdoll doesn't like differences any greater than 10x, sometimes 100x, else it can fail or become unstable. For example, if your character has a mass of 100kg, and the foot Marker has a mass of 0.5kg, that's a ratio of 100/0.5 = 200x which is far greater than Ragdoll would like. As a result, the body would *crush* the foot which would be unable to properly hold the entire body up.

    Up until now, the masses on all Markers have had a default value of 1kg. Meaning that regardless of the *size* of a Marker - be it the torso, the head or tip of a finger - it would always have a mass of 1.0. As a result, *hands* would typically end up far heavier than the rest of the body.

**Before**

Here's an example of the solver failing. There are three identical chains, the tip of the last one having a mass of 10,000. That's 10,000x greater then each link in the chain. As a result, Markers separate; that is incorrect.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146761954-6218f6bf-9fbe-4100-b831-589fd7d94914.mp4 controls

**After**

If we limit the maximum ratio to just 1000x, we get the correct behavior. You can also see how it affected the other two chains. They now behave more similarly, because in order to ensure a mass ratio across the whole system, the mass of their tips need to be reduced as well.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146761956-211ce2b6-42b6-4f70-a9de-42326b4fb17c.mp4 controls


The new `Max Mass Ratio` attribute protects against these situations, letting you give objects a suitable mass and only have to worry about which should weigh more, and which should weigh less. Ragdoll will balance everything out before passing it along to be simulated.

!!! info "What are the consequences?"
    Sometimes, large mass ratios are what you want. For example, a heavy weight on a string tends to do quite well with ratios up to 1000x. But markers being crushed by another marker 1000x its weight tends to not do as well.

    So the result is less of an effect at the extreme ratios.

<br>

### Level of Detail

Setup your character once with all bells-and-whistles, and interactively pick which level of detail to use for your simulation in a given situation.

**Usecases**

1. Body at `Level 0`, fingers at `Level 1`
2. Props at `Level 1`, muscles at `Level 2`
3. Major masses at `Level 0`, extremities at `Level 1` and `Level 2`

For example, here's a Wasp character with 3 levels of increasing detail.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/148215131-87811017-307a-4363-9ba8-a9a7d816f29b.mp4 controls

As you'd expect, it'll record only the currently active markers.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/148215124-5a937bec-0c34-4fbb-83b0-54b09646ae1e.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Workflow

Here's how it works.

1. Give each marker a "level", such as `1`
2. Tell solver which "level" to solve at, such as `1`

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/148227206-42a1e54b-6185-46c2-9d90-0d720c657add.mp4 controls

And that's it! Any marker with a matching level is simulated and recorded.

<br>

#### Operators

What does each level mean? The answer lies in the "operator".

| Operator  | Description
|:----------|:-----------
| `Less Than` | If the `Marker Level` is less than (or equal) to the `Solver Level`, simulate it.
| `Greater Than` | If the `Marker Level` is greater than (or equal) to the `Solver Level`, simulate it.
| `Equal` | If the `Marker Level` is *equal* to the `Solver Level`, simulate it.
| `NotEqual` | If the `Marker Level` is *not equal* to the `Solver Level`, simulate it.

With these, you can use each level for..

1. An increasing amount of detail
2. An increasing amount of *reduction*
3. Something completely custom

With `Equal` and `NotEqual` operators, you can have some markers appear or disappear on particular levels, enabling endless combinations.

**Roadmap**

This should cover a majority of cases, but there are things you cannot yet do, but will be able to in the future.

1. `Capsule` on one level, `Mesh` on another. For higher-resolution contacts.
2. Dense hierarchy of controls at one level, sparse at another. For e.g. twist joints versus a simple 2-joint chain, or a densely packed spine versus just hip and torso controls.

<br>

### Truly Non-keyable

Some Ragdoll attributes are keyable, others are not. Which is which? Impossible to say. Until now!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/147100689-228d7408-0f1c-4a57-a4d5-442d8284a5cc.mp4 controls

On attempting to keyframe a non-keyable attribute, you'll now see an error message along with a visual cue things might not work out the way you expect. As opposed to happily setting that keyframe but then ignoring it once the simulation starts, like it used to.

A little quality of life for ya'!

!!! tip "Pro-tip for Riggers"
    There are at least 2 ways to prevent non-keyable attributes from being keyframed.

    1. `MFnAttribute::setConnectable(false);`
    2. `MPxNode::legalConnection()`

    The former means you are also unable to make a control and connect it to multiple non-keyable attributes. Like if you wanted to control `Mass` of a series of markers from a single source, or the `Overlap Group`.

    The latter on the other hand is more flexible. It allows Ragdoll to prevent connections to *specific* attributes or types of nodes, like `animCurve` nodes, which means animators won't be able to keyframe it but you'll still be able to build controls for it.

    And that's exactly how it works.

<br>

### Markers API

With the retirement of the legacy Python API, a new API has sprung up in its place. This time featuring the Markers.

```py
from ragdoll import api

box = cmds.polyCube()

solver = api.createSolver()
marker = api.assignMarker(box[0], solver)

api.record()
```

<br>

### Mandarin Serial Number

It has come to my attention that the first thing every new user of Ragdoll sees is this dialog, with this message for a serial number.

!!! question "Any yet.."
    Nobody has said a thing! 🤣

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146526900-6815e9ad-4da3-4531-bb2c-bb0e239affff.png)

According to my Mandarin-speaking friends, this is jibberish (or at least should be!) and is a result of badly translated Unicode to ASCII characters.

This has now been fixed!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146527505-c79a897c-74cc-4e4c-b3c3-becae0ebd99d.png)

<br>

### Delta Drawing Bug

The worldspace deltas were drawn separate from the marker they affected, which could produce a jarring effect especially when the solver position had been offset.

**Before**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146639337-8df8d52e-8e6f-4d87-94f8-5973b03a7f1e.mp4 controls

**After**

This has now been fixed.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146639364-34dcba69-b174-4950-8431-19303fb343f4.mp4 controls

!!! info "More Performance"
    As an added bonus, we're now also doing 2 matrix multiplications less *per frame*, *per marker*. That kind of thing adds up quickly.

<br>

### Shape Sync

If you play, pause and then change the `Shape` from `Box` to `Capsule` nothing happens. Because the shape, like many other attributes, can only be changed on the start frame.

But, when you later returned to the start frame, the shape would *still* not update. This has now been fixed.

<br>

### Profiler View

Mostly meant to keep the development of Ragdoll fast and interactive, you can now spot where most time is spent via the built-in Maya Profiler.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146942224-d88c9ec1-d58f-4213-ad63-2d3f11a91ccf.mp4 controls

Here's what one frame of this looks like; 5 ms to both simulate and render Ragdoll in the viewport.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/146941905-b56fd84a-5cbf-4bfc-84fd-63ecfaabb2a6.png)

<br>

### Legacy API

Known now as `ragdoll.legacy`, this is where legacy functionality such as `create_active_rigid()` and `create_point_constraint()` resides.

<br>

### Removed Attributes

These attributes were no longer relevant in the last release, but were still present in the Channel Editor. These have now been *hidden* and will no longer be saved with your file. A few weeks from now, they will be removed.

- `limitAutoOrient`
- `limitType`
- `limitAxis`
- `limitOffsetX`
- `limitOffsetY`
- `limitOffsetZ`
- `limitOffset`
- `limitRotationX`
- `limitRotationY`
- `limitRotationZ`
- `limitRotation`
