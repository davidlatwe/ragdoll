### Fields

<br>

#### Force Modes

Fields can apply to your markers in 4 different ways.

| Mode             | Description | Math
|:-----------------|:------------|:----------
| Force            | Traditional force | `mass * distance / time^2`
| Impulse          |             | `mass * distance / time`
| Velocity Change  | Independent of mass | `distance / time`
| Acceleration     | Like Force, except mass is taken into account | `distance / time^2`
