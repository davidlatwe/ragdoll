<br>

#### Ignore Field

Fields can be assigned either to the solver - in which case it affects all the things in that solver - or per-marker for ultimate control.

<br>

#### Force Modes

Fields can apply to your markers in 4 different ways.

| Mode             | Description | Math
|:-----------------|:------------|:----------
| Force            | Traditional force            | `mass * distance / time^2`
| Impulse          | Typically used for contacts  | `mass * distance / time`

<br>

### Import Additions

These attributes were added to the export and import mechanism.

| Nice Name                 | Long Name
|:--------------------------|:------------
| World Pose Translate X    | `driveAbsoluteLinearX`
| World Pose Translate Y    | `driveAbsoluteLinearY`
| World Pose Translate Z    | `driveAbsoluteLinearZ`
| Pose Twist Amount         | `driveAngularAmountTwist`
| Pose Swing Amount         | `driveAngularAmountSwing`

<br>

### Ignore Gravity

Alongside the new fields, a Marker can be instructed to ignore it, or fields. Or both altogether.

<br>

### Capsule Length

All this time, capsules had been scaled in an axis that didn't align with your scale manipulator. :blush:

No longer!
