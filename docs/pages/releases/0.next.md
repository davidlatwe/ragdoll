Highlight for this release is ...

- [**ADDED** Environment](#environment) Complex collision geometry, without the need for geometry simplification.
- [**ADDED** Automatic Mesh Islands](#automatic-mesh-islands) Ragdoll can now cut meshes for you, with a customisable amount of accuracy.
- [**ADDED** Licence Conservation](#licence-conservation) Lease only the licences you actively use
- [**ADDED** Select with the Manipulator](#select-with-the-manipulator) Selecting Markers got a bit easier
- [**ADDED** Export Flag](#export-flag) Choose which nodes to export
- [**FIXED** Multiple Manipulators](#multiple-manipulators) Two or more solvers no longre breaks the Manipulator

### Licence Conservation

!!! note "Applies to"
    This feature only applies to Floating Licence customers.

In the previous release, a licence was leased on plug-in load.

The problem was that, sometimes, an artist merely opens a scene with Ragdoll in it. Maya will determine that this file requires the Ragdoll plug-in to be loaded, and loads it. Upon load, Ragdoll would go ahead and check out a licence. But this artist doesn't necessarily want to interact with Ragdoll, it could have been a texture artist opening up an animator's scene, or someone rendering it.

This release introduces "licence conservation" which only tries to lease a licence upon a simulation taking place. That means a lease is not made on plug-in load, nor on scene open. If a solver is hidden from view, nor does it take place on playback start.

Only once simulation visibly begins is a lease requested, helping you save those precious seats for the artists that need it most.

Markers are still rendered in the viewport on the start frame for everyone, without a lease. The Solver is automatically hidden upon failure to lease a licence, pausing any further requests until it is made visible again.

- Fix crash on fit-to-view
- Fix crash on replaced mesh with 0 vertices
- Hide prototype world and local attributes on rdgroup
