### Quality of Life

Some improvements and reshufflings to make your life more complete. ðŸ¥°

<br>

#### Robust Recording

There hasn't yet been any rig not supported by Ragdoll, until last week when @mandala got in touch with a new challenge. A rig made with an auto-rigging plug-in called [Contour](https://www.notionalpipe.com/software).

Recording this rig resulted in cycle warnings, presumably because part of how it operates depends on viewport updates.

In this update, there is a `Nice and Steady` option for recording which ensures the viewport stays up-to-date with the dependency graph, and that did the trick!

#### Scale Replace

In the case of scaled markers with a replaced mesh, this happened.

But no longer!

<br>

#### Offline Trial Notification

Whenever someone attempts to trial Ragdoll, but their machine is not connected to the internet, they would receive a message about how their Trial has expired.. Even though it was never activated in the first place!

This has now been fixed.

#### World Translate Visualisation

The translation component of the World Pose Space wasn't very visible before, now it is! It's also drawn using the color of the Marker it's associated with, to aid in figuring out what it's actually affecting. And also make things a little nicer to look at.

#### Record Leaving Joints Behind

<br>

#### Existing Constraints Deleted on Record

Under rare circumstances, it's possible to assign a marker onto a control that's been constrained. It wouldn't make sense to record onto this control; because what should you expect to have happen? The control is either animated or it is constrained.

At the moment, this constraint is also recorded and once complete your original constraint is deleted. If possible! If the constraint is from a referenced file, then you'll instead see an error. ðŸ¤”

<br>

#### Record Range Options

The Record UI has seen some updates. It used to always record your current playback range, but can now be customised.

**Record To Selecteed Range**

You can now drag-select on the timeline to record only that specific region.

**Record Full Range**

The minimum and maximum range on your timeline, beyond what is played back.

**Record Playback Range**

Record only the range currently played back, this is the default and current behavior.

**Customise Range**

And finally, provide your own values. These values, along with the option of which range to pick from, is remembered alongside your Maya preferences just like all other Ragdoll options.

<br>

#### Existing Constraints

In the rare circumstance of:

1. Assigning to a constrained control
2. That is also kinematic
3. And running `Record`

You would find yourself with a missing constraint. As it happens, when Maya encounters an existing constraint it won't actually create a new constraint when you try and constrain again. Instead, it will *append* to this constraint.

As a result, since Recording constrains your character to the simulation and then bakes the keyframes, once it was complete and went on to clean up any new constraints it had made, it also deleted yours.

This has now been fixed.

<br>

#### Manipulator & Multiple Viewports

The Ragdoll Manipulator didn't like multiple viewports being present at the same time, resulting in a similar situation as [2021.12.15](https://learn.ragdolldynamics.com/releases/2021.12.15/#robust-viewport-icons).

Ragdoll now draws and responds to the manipulator in the currently active viewport.

<br>

#### Plug-in Unload and New Scene

Sometimes, especially on a floating licence, you'd like to release your licence such that another artist can pick it up.

To do that, you can either go to the Ragdoll UI and `Drop Lease` for a floating licence of `Deactivate` for a node-locked licence. Or, you can simply unload the plug-in.

As it happens, if you did then Ragdoll would clear your scene. Without confirmation. ðŸ˜µ

This has now been fixed. You'll still need to ensure no Ragdoll nodes are present in your scene though, like any normal plug-in.
