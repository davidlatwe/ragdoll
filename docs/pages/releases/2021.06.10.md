title: More Bugfixes
description: A number of bugs were harmed in the making of this release.
---

Highlight for this release is **more bugfixes**, in preparation for launch.

- [**FIXED** Fractional Start Time](#fractional-start-time) This could cause a nasty crash
- [**FIXED** Suspend on Bake](#suspend-on-bake) Faster baking now that this works!
- [**FIXED** More Resilient Constraint Rendering](#more-resilient-constraint-rendering) Optimised and less noisy

### Fractional Start Time

You wouldn't normally set your start time to `0.8` or `16.351`, but it can happen whether you like it or not if e.g. physics was made in one scene and later referenced into another with differing frame rates. Such as 24 fps in one, and 30 fps in another.

If that happened, then best case your simulation flickers on the first frame, worst case you're looking at a fatal crash.

Why?

In this illustration, you can see how the simulation (<strong style="color: #40B1E6">blue</strong>) progresses alongside time (<strong style="color: red">red</strong>). As we reach just beyond a whole frame, such as 1.1, you'll notice how the simulation immediately fills in that whole frame; even though we haven't actually reached the end yet!

The result is a simulation that operates on incomplete information. Your animation at frame `1.1` is not where it is at frame `2`.

In this release, here's what happens instead.

Now we're only simulating once we've actually reached a whole frame step. Your animation has reached the full pose at that frame and that's what will be used to compute the simulation. As you would expect.

!!! question "Does this mean I can playback in fractional frames?"
    Not yet, simulation happens on whole frames and won't output anything until the next whole frame. At a later date, fractional frames will be automatically interpolated, similar to when you bake a simulation and set keys to `linear`.

    This isn't typically useful for animation, but can help with motion blur during the rendering of fast-moving objects; especially spinning objects like propellers and wheels.

That said, you *can* achieve some pretty surreal effects with this. :D

Stay tuned for real-time interpolation, and do [let me know](https://ragdolldynamics.com/contact) if this is something you're interested in.

### Suspend on Bake

Baking is fast and light with the default option for disabling the viewport as it runs, but should you also opt to delete physics once baking is complete you would find suspension to have no effect. :(

This was due to deletion of physics also suspending the viewport as it deletes things and - wanting to be helpful - went ahead and resumed rendering of the viewport before baking got a chance to get started.

This has now been fixed.

!!! hint "Speed!"
    0.51 seconds versus 0.13 seconds, a 4x speedup!

### More Resilient Constraint Rendering

You are unlikely to end up with zero scaled things, but if you do you could also run into visual flicker like this.

**Before**

**After**

Not only is this gone, it's fast too. It is as fast as though the constraints were never visible to begin with, giving you another option for hiding them. Scaling them down. Hah!
