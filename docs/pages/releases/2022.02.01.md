**Batman Writes**

A behind-the-scenes from Jason's cool constraint setup.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151856154-a53a0d72-c8b3-483b-9968-69518b592e9b.mp4 controls


<br>

### Kinematic & Dynamic

> Also known as "Animated" and "Simulated"

Marker behaviour has been simplified.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151945905-8a17e615-085f-4009-8bd7-1e905266ec9a.mp4 controls

Groups are now either `Kinematic` - for fully animated, no physics involved - or `Dynamic` for having things affected by gravity and contacts with other Markers.

In the above example, I'm alternating between `Kinematic` and `Dynamic` for the entire character.

!!! info "Changed"
    As part of this simplification, two things have changed.

    1. `Initial State` was removed
    2. `Pose Match` was renamed to `Dynamic`

    Initial State can be achieved with `Dynamic` and a `Pose Stiffness` of `0`.

And like before, individual markers can be overridden to be either `Kinematic` or `Dynamic`. When set to `Inherit` it continues to use whatever value was found in the group.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151943779-a1871bb0-fd17-40e1-8f4f-e064528ad8af.mp4 controls

..speaking of which!

<br>

### Group

In the previous version, a group was automatically created whenever you assign to a connected series of controls.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151968589-42dc9165-6dfc-478e-ac3f-b5be4eae6561.png)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151788893-345a812e-8a33-4f66-9747-5e7348203f7a.mp4 control

This release enables you to group standalone markers too, and to retroactively group markers in any way you please.

#### New Group

Select some markers, put them in a group.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151788793-ab9be9fa-1982-495e-ba59-7aec73c4f1fc.mp4 control

#### Move To Group

Select one or more markers, along with a destination group, and move them.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151786597-144ac006-d9a9-43e5-83a5-a2a5a1265795.mp4 control

#### Group on Assign

When assigning markers, you are now also able to pick which group to put it into, or whether to make a new group. Or no group!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151789122-5daa59a4-1a94-4169-bae2-2ab513ee1d1e.mp4 control

<br>

### Lollipop 2.0

Lollipops now feature Marker and Group attributes in the Channel Box; less clicks!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151803985-290d94d5-2c8c-4cab-900f-8ce6df8d8e75.mp4 controls

#### Customisable

Rotate and scale the resulting lollipops to fit your rig and workflow.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151803987-fbf3fa8f-9f28-4f7b-a216-91c1bef5c2a1.mp4 controls

#### Retroactive Lollipops

Should you have markers without a lollipop, assign them afterwards using the Lollipop menu item. This is also where you can customise which attributes should appear on them.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151803990-8f13f7e4-e9a8-4048-b57d-3882926054e5.mp4 controls

!!! tip "Pro tip"
    The `Use Proxy Attributes` option makes attributes editable both on the Lollipop *and* on the original Marker. The downside however is that they make life in the Graph Editor less pleasant. ðŸ¤”

    | With Proxy Attributes | Without Proxy Attributes

### Quality of Life

Some improvements and reshufflings to make your life more complete. ðŸ¥°

<br>

#### Robust Recording

There hasn't yet been any rig not supported by Ragdoll, until last week when @mandala got in touch with a new challenge. A rig made with an rigging system plug-in called [Contour](https://www.notionalpipe.com/software).

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151809381-d31f166a-e2bd-4417-b876-2df9a7d00d54.mp4 controls

Recording this rig results in cycle warnings, presumably because part of how it operates depends on viewport updates.

In this update, there is a (default) `Nice and Steady` option for recording which ensures the viewport stays up-to-date with the dependency graph, and that did the trick!

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151555009-e40e9e7e-2892-402e-b77e-1a4f5bb879aa.mp4

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151555701-72941449-44cb-4fbc-a7ed-8f9bc6614cce.png)

<br>

#### Match By Name

Importing markers onto a character in a different group, or a different character altogether, could be tricky since their hierarchies would differ.

There is now an option to find a matching control by *name* rather than its full path.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151807504-091a1e91-40a1-4785-bf49-c8ed0a300800.mp4 controls

In this example, the character has a different parent group than when it was exported, changing all of the full paths to each control.

<br>

#### Scale Replace

In the case of scaled markers with a replaced mesh, this happened.

**Before**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/150535955-78d95102-c250-4af7-b3a8-ab2454ef1a98.mp4 controls

But no longer!

**After**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/150536000-76f4013f-2246-400b-b672-bb2fba959a06.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Offline Activation Wizard

The offline activation process has now been streamlined; no longer requiring an email conversation back and forth. It should take some of our load off, whilst at the same time enabling you to offline activate when we are sleeping. ðŸ˜…

- https://learn.ragdolldynamics.com/licencing/#offline-activation

**Activation**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151695125-ded8c7f2-077d-4db6-8ea9-499a30f7c5c3.mp4 controls

**Deactivation**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151695127-ad177ba8-f7e7-425a-99df-6aa541c81b8e.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Offline Trial Notification

Whenever someone attempts to trial Ragdoll, but their machine is not connected to the internet, they would receive a message about how their Trial has expired.. Even though it was never activated in the first place!

This has now been fixed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/150632340-905dcc3c-600e-40ec-85cf-72651022b059.png)

<br>

#### World Translate Visualisation

The translation component of the World Pose Space wasn't very visible before, now it is! It's also drawn using the color of the Marker it's associated with, to aid in figuring out what it's actually affecting. And also make things a little nicer to look at.

**Before**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/150762597-22b499ad-04ef-4adf-aca2-61dd8755ec14.mp4 controls

**After**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/150761794-ecbd9f53-c9dd-4227-8b6d-d04d0de15dab.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Record Leaving Joints Behind

Sometimes, Ragdoll could leave some remains after recording your simulation. This has now been fixed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/150783883-b62fbec0-5ef7-4090-a08c-2231984cf7e0.png)

<br>

#### Existing Constraints Deleted on Record

Under rare circumstances, it's possible to assign a marker onto a control that's been constrained. It wouldn't make sense to record onto this control; because what should you expect to have happen? The control is either animated or it is constrained.

At the moment, this constraint is also recorded and once complete your original constraint is deleted. If possible! If the constraint is from a referenced file, then you'll instead see an error. ðŸ¤”

<br>

#### Record Range Options

The Record UI has seen some updates. It used to always record your current playback range, but can now be customised.

**Record To Selected Range**

You can now drag-select on the timeline to record only that specific region.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151520002-713e8507-1e61-4d10-84ce-d6e8cd3d2c56.mp4 controls

**Record Full Range**

The minimum and maximum range on your timeline, beyond what is played back.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151520008-cf7d1d53-6af6-4071-9295-0a72f40b1277.mp4 controls

**Record Playback Range**

Record only the range currently played back, this is the default and current behaviour.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151520012-9cf6645c-527d-481a-89f7-8f2b75aee58f.mp4 controls

**Customise Range**

And finally, provide your own values. These values, along with the option of which range to pick from, is remembered alongside your Maya preferences just like all other Ragdoll options.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151520015-e236544b-b5c4-4c75-80d9-9352fc607566.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Existing Constraints

In the rare circumstance of:

1. Assigning to a constrained control
2. That is also kinematic
3. And running `Record`

You would find yourself with a missing constraint. As it happens, when Maya encounters an existing constraint it won't actually create a new constraint when you try and constrain again. Instead, it will *append* to this constraint.

As a result, since Recording constrains your character to the simulation and then bakes the keyframes, once it was complete and went on to clean up any new constraints it had made, it also deleted yours.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151523476-aa053bc6-1b9c-4fe9-bd18-7e41fc1d5f76.mp4 controls

This has now been fixed.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151523477-a4978ad3-850e-44b8-8082-cf9ec0b1ce83.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Manipulator & Multiple Viewports

The Ragdoll Manipulator didn't like multiple viewports being present at the same time, resulting in a similar situation as [2021.12.15](https://learn.ragdolldynamics.com/releases/2021.12.15/#robust-viewport-icons).

Ragdoll now draws and responds to the manipulator in the currently active viewport.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151557284-7e0efb51-81de-40ff-a3f5-c1226a92db71.mp4 controls

<br>

#### Plug-in Unload and New Scene

Sometimes, especially on a floating licence, you'd like to release your licence such that another artist can pick it up.

To do that, you can either go to the Ragdoll UI and `Drop Lease` for a floating licence of `Deactivate` for a node-locked licence. Or, you can simply unload the plug-in.

As it happens, if you did then Ragdoll would clear your scene. Without confirmation. ðŸ˜µ

This has now been fixed. You'll still need to ensure no Ragdoll nodes are present in your scene though, like any normal plug-in.

<br>

#### Delete from Selection

A new menu item has been added to delete physics only from the current selection.

!!! tip "Pro tip I"
    This was possible using the `Use Selection` option within the `Delete Physics` option dialog.

!!! tip "Pro tip II"
    Markers can also be manually deleted in the Outliner, they are DG nodes.

!!! tip "Pro tip III"
    Another way of deleting an individual marker is:

    1. Select your assigned control
    1. Select Marker in Channel Box
    2. Deselect control
    3. Hit `Delete` or `Backspace` on your keyboard

!!! tip "Pro tip IV"
    Yet *another* way of deleting an individual marker is:

    1. Select your assigned control
    2. Select Marker in Channel Box
    3. Ctrl + Right-click on marker
    4. Select `Delete Node`

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2152766/151699246-201486ba-2c56-45b2-bcc1-ca0b3fc01621.mp4

<br>

#### Minor Tweaks

- Limits are now included when importing physics
- `Drive Space Custom` appears under in the channel box when `Drive Space = Custom`
- Pin Constraint now visible in Wireframe mode
- Pin Constraint visible both with solver offset and at the origin
- Distance and Pin Constraints can now be hidden via the Outliner
- The `Include Kinematic` option for record has been fixed
- Python API: The `opts` argument of `api.reinterpret` is repaired
