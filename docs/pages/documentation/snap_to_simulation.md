The fundamental building block to Ragdoll, for "reverse motion capture" or Animation Capture.

### Snap to Simulation

Yet another way to work with physics, by transferring individual poses from the solver into your animation. You can use it to pose or layout a scene.

!!! note "Coming Up"
    An upcoming release will enable you to advance time in the simulation, without affecting time in Maya. Such that you can "relax" a pose, for example. üòÅ

#### A Debugging Companion

It can also be used for situations where `Record Simulation` doesn't do what you need it to. The extracted skeleton will be a plain joint hierarchy, with no scale, and guaranteed to match the simulation exactly. So you can extract it, and constrain your rig to it.
