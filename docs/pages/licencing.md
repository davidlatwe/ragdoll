## Overview

Let's cover the basics..

- Ragdoll requires a commercial licence for commercial use
- Ragdoll is free for non-commercial use
- Ragdoll is free for testing within a commercial environment

About activation..

- A commercial licence is activated with a `Product Key`
- Get a `Product Key` by [purchasing a licence](https://ragdolldynamics.com/pricing)
- A non-commercial licence is activated automatically on launch
- A non-commercial licence expires 30 days after activation

## Ragdoll Apprentice

Once activated without a `Product Key`, Ragdoll enters "Apprentice Mode", and is limited to the following.

- Non-commercial projects
- Ragdoll Apprentice cannot be used in the same pipeline as commercial versions of Ragdoll
- Ragdoll Apprentice uses its own file format for Maya scenes

See the [Ragdoll EULA](https://files.ragdolldynamics.com/api/public/dl/ZmfQearE/EULA%20-%20Ragdoll%20Dynamics.pdf) for details.

## FAQ

Let's dive into specifics.

<br>

#### How does it work?

On first launch, Ragdoll will try and connect to the Ragdoll Licence Server and register your trial version. This version is node-locked to the particular machine you are on.

Once you've acquired a product key, you can either:

1. Click the `Ragdoll` menu item (bottom)
2. Enter your product key
3. Click `Activate`

Or if you prefer:

```py
from ragdoll import licence
licence.activate(key)
```

<br>

#### What happens when my trial expires?

Any `rdScene.enabled` attribute will be set to `False`.

Scenes will still load just fine and nothing else in your scene is affected. Once activated, the `.enabled` attribute will return to normal.

<br>

#### Can I renew my trial licence?

Possibly. Reach out to us if this is relevant to you.

<br>

#### Can I open scenes made with the trial version in the commercial version?

No.

Files made with Ragdoll Apprentice will appear scrambled with a commercial version. Ragdoll Apprentice is however able to read files saved with a commercial version.

<br>

#### Can I use my licence on more than one machine?

- Yes, for Ragdoll Personal
- No, for Ragdoll Complete, Unlimited and Batch

With Ragdoll Personal, you can activate and use each Ragdoll licence on up to 3 machines. You just can't run a simulation on more than 1 machine per 1 licence at any given time, that could lead to suspension of the licence.

<br>

#### Can I move a licence between two machines?

Yes.

You can hit the `Deactivate` button (which is same as the `Activate` button once you've activated) and the activation will be released.

<br>

#### Do I need an internet connection to use Ragdoll?

No.

Activation can happen either offline or online, online happening from within Maya at the click of a button and offline being a 4-step process, [see below](#can-i-activate-offline).

<br>

#### How do I use my floating licence?

Floating licences have two parts.

1. A self-hosted licence server
2. The Ragdoll plug-in

Whenever Ragdoll is loaded from Maya, it connects to your licence server in order to "lease" a licence. If you own 10 licences, then one of them will remain leased until the plug-in is unloaded from Maya.

- [Managing Floating Licences](/floating-licence)

<br>

#### Can I activate offline?

Yes.

See [Offline Activation](#offline-activation) below.

<br>

#### When exactly is internet required?

A connection is made in one of two separate occasions.

1. Calling `ragdoll.licence.install()` from Python
2. On simulating any frame

`install()` is typically called when the plug-in is loaded and menu is installed.

That is, Maya can open a scene with Ragdoll in it without making a connection to the internet if neither of these things happen. This means you can simulate on one machine, bake or otherwise disable the solver and send it off to a farm (e.g. local or cloud) without worrying about licences.

The alternative would be having to erase any trace of Ragdoll from a scene which would be such a pain.

<br>

#### Can I manage my licence via Python?

Sure can, see below.

<br>

## Licence API

As a user, you'll generally use the UI. But the UI is ultimately making calls to Python (which is making calls to C++) and you can bypass the UI using these same calls.

```py
from ragdoll import licence

# Called once before calling any other licencing function
# This is automatically called on Ragdoll Python initialisation
# and simulation start, but needs calling manually if simulation
# hasn't yet started.
licence.install()

# Retrieve the currently activated product key
licence.current_key()

# Activate using your product ket
licence.activate(key)

# Activation for those without access to Internet
licence.activation_request_to_file(key, fname)
licence.activate_from_file(fname)

# Deactivate whatever key is currently activated
licence.deactivate()

# Deactivate offline, to e.g. move a licence from one machine to another
licence.deactivation_request_to_file(fname)

# Dictionary of useful information
data = licence.data()

{
	# Same as current_key
    "key": "Your-Key",

    # Is the current licence activated?
    "isActivated": True,

    # Is the current licence a trial licence?
    "isTrial": False,

    # Has the licence not been tampered with?
    "isGenuine": True,

    # Has the licence been verified with the server
    # (requires a connection to the internet)?
    "isVerified": True,

    # How many days until this trial expires?
    "trialDays": 23
}
```

## Offline Activation

Haven't got no internet?

No problem, here's what you do.

1. Generate an **"activation request"** file
2. Send the contents of this file, or the file itself to licencing@ragdolldynamics.com
3. Receive a **"activation response"** file
4. Activate using this file

It requires pasting some *Python* commands into the **Maya Script Editor**.

**1. Generate Request**

```py
from maya import cmds
from ragdoll import licence
key = "YOUR-VERY-LONG-KEY-HERE"
fname = cmds.fileDialog2(fileFilter="*.xml", dialogStyle=1, fileMode=0)
licence.activation_request_to_file(key, fname[0]) if fname else cmds.warning("Cancelled")
```

**2. Email Us**

Either send the file, or the contents of the file, to licencing@ragdolldynamics.com.

**3. Receive a response**

We'll abrakadabra this file before you can say [Taumatawhakatangi足hangakoauauotamatea足turipukakapikimaunga足horonukupokaiwhen足uakitanatahu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taumatawhakatangi%C2%ADhangakoauauotamatea%C2%ADturipukakapikimaunga%C2%ADhoronukupokaiwhen%C2%ADuakitanatahu).

**4. Activate**

Once you've got a response, activate your licence like this.

```py
from maya import cmds
from ragdoll import licence
fname = cmds.fileDialog2(fileFilter="*.xml", dialogStyle=1, fileMode=1)
licence.activate_from_file(fname[0]) if fname else cmds.warning("Cancelled")
```

<br>

## Offline Deactivation

Licences are node-locked (floating licences coming soon), which means that if you need to move a licence from one machine to another you can do so by *deactivating* an activated licence, and then activating it elsewhere.

The process is similar to activation.

**Generate Request**

```py
from maya import cmds
from ragdoll import licence
fname = cmds.fileDialog2(fileFilter="*.xml", dialogStyle=1, fileMode=0)
licence.deactivation_request_to_file(fname)
```

**Email Us**

Send this file to licencing@ragdolldynamics.com. Once we have confirmed receipt of this file, you will be able to re-activate Ragdoll on another machine.

## Offline Licence Roadmap

Apologies for the tedious nature of offline licence management at the moment! Not long from now, you will be able to manage your licences *online* without sending any emails.
